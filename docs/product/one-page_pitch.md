# One-Page Game Pitch

A one-page pitch (or one-sheet) in video games is a single-page document that provides a concise, high-level summary of a game concept to quickly communicate its essence to stakeholders like investors, publishers, or team members. It serves as the project's "north star," ensuring alignment and capturing attention in a competitive industry.

## Key Components
The primary goal is brevity and clarity, focusing on the game's unique selling points (USPs) and emotional hook rather than extensive details.

| Component                         | Description                                                                                                             |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title & Logo                      | The game's name and a strong visual brand identity.                                                                     |
| Elevator Pitch / Logline          | A single, catchy sentence or two that sums up the core concept and hook (e.g., "It's like X except Y").                 |
| Overview / Premise                | A short paragraph detailing the game's setting, tone, narrative, and general appeal.                                    |
| Core Mechanics / Features         | Bullet points highlighting the innovative or most appealing gameplay elements and what makes the game fun or different. |
| Target Audience & Platform        | The intended players, game genre, and the systems (PC, console, mobile) the game will run on.                           |
| Visuals                           | Concept art, key art, or screenshots that establish the art style and visual identity.                                  |
| Team & Ask (for external pitches) | A brief introduction to the team's experience and a clear "ask" regarding funding or support.                           |

## Purpose and Best Practices

- Capture attention: Publishers and investors receive dozens of pitches, so the one-pager must immediately grab interest.
- Clarify the vision: The process of creating the one-pager helps the development team solidify their own vision and scope control.
- Lead the reader to action: A successful one-pager makes the audience want to learn more, leading to further meetings or a request for a full pitch deck, prototype, or vertical slice.

Think of it as a marketing tool designed to sell an idea effectively in a limited space. Visuals and clean formatting are crucial to make the information digestible at a glance. Many publishers, such as [Raw Fury](https://rawfury.com/developer-resources/) and [Devolver Digital](https://pitch.devolverdigital.com/), provide specific guidelines and templates for what they expect in a pitch submission
